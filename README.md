# AQA-TAF-for-ebay.com-with-Selenium-Grid
https:/ebay.com was chosen as the testing page. Testing was done through Google Chrome and Firefox browsers, using Selenium Greed.
The final project folder contains two results in .html format.
Test Result - RunnerTest_OLD.html â€“ old version with better performance.
2 error results - an attempt to enter incorrect data when logging into the account. 
The ebay.com site is equipped with a bot protection system in the form of a captcha. 
When such element is detected on the page, a warning is issued to the console:
  Unfortunately, you have been identified as a robot.
  Maybe too many attempts have been made.
  Please verify yourself
After the changes, Test Results - RunnerTest_NEW.html - with worse indicators were obtained. 
Project must running through RunnerTestNG in the upper right corner, with the hub and nod raised through Selenium Greed.
